This repository contains my answers to all the questions in [The Scheme
Programming Language, 4th Edition](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/). Some of
those may not be as good as the ones in the official
[answers](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/answers.html) chapter.

Status: currently containing answers to all exercises in chapters 2 and 3,
except 3.3.5.
